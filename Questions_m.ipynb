One of these travels downtown to his mother, the other travels uptown to his girlfriend. His mother complains that she never sees him since she has only seen him twice in the last 20 working days. Explain this\n",

    "1. John the analyst talks to Mary, who is also an analyst. Mary learns that John's sister has three children. John tells her the product of their ages is 36. Mary thinks a while, then asks for more information. John then says, \"The sum of their ages is here\", pointing at his computer screen. Mary thinks, again asks for more information. John then says, \"The oldest is dyslexic.\" What are the children's ages?\n",
