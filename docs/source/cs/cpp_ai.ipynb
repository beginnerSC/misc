    "\n",
    "This video provides an **absolute beginner’s guide to CMake**, focusing on its role in compiling and building C/C++ projects, particularly in the context of Raspberry Pi Pico development but broadly applicable to many environments. It explains the relationship between **compilers**, **build systems**, and **build system generators** using clear examples and step-by-step demonstrations.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core Concepts and Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Compiling C Programs with GCC:**\n",
    "  - The simplest step is compiling a single C file (e.g., `hello_world.c`) into a binary using `gcc -o hello_world hello_world.c`.\n",
    "  - Flags like `-O3` enable optimizations.\n",
    "  - For multi-file projects, multiple source files (e.g., `main.c`, `random.c`) can be compiled together by listing all files in one GCC command, including linking libraries like the math library (`-lm`).\n",
    "  - Alternatively, source files can be compiled separately to object files (`.o`) with `-c` flags and then linked together.\n",
    "- **Need for Automation:**\n",
    "  - Manual compilation becomes impractical for larger projects (e.g., htop with 128 C files or Linux kernel with 20,000+ files).\n",
    "  - **Make** is introduced as a longstanding automation tool that uses a `Makefile` to define build targets, dependencies, and commands.\n",
    "  - Simple Makefiles define targets like `hello_world` depending on `hello_world.c`, specifying how to compile it.\n",
    "  - Make supports commands like `make clean` to remove build artifacts.\n",
    "  - Makefiles can become very complex, managing variables for compiler flags, source file lists, object files, and cross-platform or debug/release builds.\n",
    "  - The Linux kernel’s top-level Makefile exceeds 2,000 lines, demonstrating complexity.\n",
    "- **Role of CMake:**\n",
    "  - CMake is described as a **build system generator** that automates the creation of Makefiles (or other build system files).\n",
    "  - It uses a simple configuration file named `CMakeLists.txt`.\n",
    "  - Workflow:\n",
    "    1. Define project and source files in `CMakeLists.txt`.\n",
    "    2. Run `cmake` to generate Makefiles (or other build files).\n",
    "    3. Use `make` (or other build tools) to build the project.\n",
    "    4. When source files or dependencies change, re-run `make`; if project structure changes, re-run `cmake`.\n",
    "  - CMake supports **out-of-source builds**, keeping generated files separate from source code to maintain directory cleanliness.\n",
    "  - Example:\n",
    "    - Source directory contains `hello_world.c` and `CMakeLists.txt`.\n",
    "    - A separate `build` directory is created.\n",
    "    - Inside `build`, run `cmake ..` to generate Makefiles.\n",
    "    - Run `make` inside `build` to compile.\n",
    "  - CMake automatically manages dependencies, including header files, so changes trigger correct recompilation.\n",
    "- **Cross-Platform and Multiple Build Systems:**\n",
    "  - CMake can generate build files for multiple systems from the same `CMakeLists.txt`:\n",
    "    - Makefiles for traditional `make`.\n",
    "    - Build files for **Ninja** (a fast build system developed for large projects like Chromium).\n",
    "    - Project files for **Visual Studio** (Windows) and **Xcode** (macOS).\n",
    "  - This cross-platform flexibility is a major strength of CMake.\n",
    "- **Ninja Build System Overview:**\n",
    "  - Ninja focuses on speed and efficiency.\n",
    "  - It uses `build.ninja` files generated by CMake.\n",
    "  - Ninja can rebuild large projects (e.g., Chromium with 30,000+ files) in under a second, compared to several seconds for `make`.\n",
    "  - Usage:\n",
    "    - Create a separate `ninja` directory.\n",
    "    - Run `cmake -G Ninja ..` to generate Ninja build files.\n",
    "    - Build by running `ninja` inside that directory.\n",

    "## [How Projects Mixing Different Languages Work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9HHWFp84f0)\n",
    "\n",
    "This video explores why some software projects involve multiple programming languages and how these languages can coexist within a single executable or process. It distinguishes between projects where different languages operate as separate processes communicating remotely (e.g., Django’s Python backend with HTML/CSS/JavaScript on the front end) and projects where multiple languages compile into a single binary. The key to this multi-language integration lies in understanding **compilation, linking, and the application binary interface (ABI)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The video begins by describing the compilation pipeline of a typical C program using GCC, revealing that the compiler is not a single-step tool but rather a **chain of tools** processing source code through multiple phases:  \n",
    "- **Pre-processing:** Handles macros, includes, and conditional compilation.  \n",
    "- **Compilation:** Translates pre-processed C code into assembly language instead of machine code directly.  \n",
    "- **Assembly:** Converts assembly code into machine code, producing object files.  \n",
    "- **Linking:** Combines multiple object files and external libraries into a complete executable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two types of linking are explained:  \n",
    "- **Static Linking:** Library functions are copied directly into the executable, creating a self-contained file.  \n",
    "- **Dynamic Linking:** Libraries are stored separately as shared objects (SO files on Unix, DLLs on Windows) and loaded at runtime, conserving disk space and memory and allowing updates without recompiling dependent programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The video emphasizes that many compilers, including GCC, support multiple languages through a **compiler collection** rather than a single compiler. GCC, originally “GNU C Compiler,” is now “GNU Compiler Collection,” supporting C, C++, Fortran, Ada, D, Go, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "An important use case is mixing languages for **performance-critical components**: writing most of the code in a higher-level language but optimizing bottlenecks with assembly or lower-level languages (e.g., C or assembly within a predominantly C project). Real-world projects such as the Linux kernel and FFmpeg use this approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "The core challenge when mixing languages into one binary is the **ABI compatibility**, which governs how functions pass arguments, return values, and manage memory at the binary level. Differences in calling conventions (e.g., which CPU registers hold parameters, pass-by-value vs pass-by-reference) between languages can cause undefined behavior or crashes if not properly handled. The video highlights that:  \n",
    "- Even if two languages compile to the same architecture, their **calling conventions must align**.  \n",
    "- Adapters or conforming the code in one language to the ABI expectations of the other is necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modern languages provide mechanisms to ease cross-language calls:  \n",
    "- **C:** `extern` keyword to declare external functions.  \n",
    "- **Rust:** `extern` keyword plus `no_mangle` attribute to expose functions with C-compatible names.  \n",
    "- **Fortran:** `bind` attribute for interoperability.  \n",
    "- **Go:** special comments and `import \"C\"` to link with C code, including inline C support.\n",
